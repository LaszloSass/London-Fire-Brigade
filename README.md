# London-Fire-Brigade

The London Fire Brigade is one of the biggest fire brigades all around the world, employing over 5000 people and having over 100 fire stations. The Grenfell Tower incident, that caused over 70 deaths in 2017, had a significant impact on the way interventions are lead and the Brigade does its best to respect its obligations, including some precise objectives.

The attendance time, the time between the reception of a call and the arrival at the incident, shouldn't exceed a certain duration and all vehicles should be able to work for hours without the need of refueling. The success of the intervention depends a lot on the location of the incident because most stations are located in Inner London, the boroughs in the center of the capital city.

As the report shows, attendance times in Outer London are much longer despite fewer incidents. Other factors including the property type, delays or the hour of the day influence the attendance time, allowing conclusions to be drawn about areas for improvement.
